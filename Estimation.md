# Estimation approach

Consider the EZWH project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course

# Summary

In the estimation by size we only considered the coding effort.

|                                    | Estimated effort | Estimated duration |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| estimate by size                   | 225 ph           | 1.5 weeks          |
| estimate by product decomposition  | 266 ph           | 1.7 weeks          |
| estimate by activity decomposition | 220 ph           | 1.4 weeks          |
