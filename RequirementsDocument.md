# Informal description

Medium companies and retailers need a simple application to manage the relationship with suppliers and the inventory of physical items stocked in a physical warehouse.
The warehouse is supervised by a manager, who supervises the availability of items. When a certain item is in short supply, the manager issues an order to a supplier. In general the same item can be purchased by many suppliers. The warehouse keeps a list of possible suppliers per item.

After some time the items ordered to a supplier are received. The items must be quality checked and stored in specific positions in the warehouse. The quality check is performed by specific roles (quality office), who apply specific tests for item (different items are tested differently). Possibly the tests are not made at all, or made randomly on some of the items received. If an item does not pass a quality test it may be rejected and sent back to the supplier.

Storage of items in the warehouse must take into account the availability of physical space in the warehouse. Further the position of items must be traced to guide later recollection of them.

The warehouse is part of a company. Other organizational units (OU) of the company may ask for items in the warehouse. This is implemented via internal orders, received by the warehouse. Upon reception of an internal order the warehouse must collect the requested item(s), prepare them and deliver them to a pick up area. When the item is collected by the other OU the internal order is completed.

EZWH (EaSy WareHouse) is a software application to support the management of a warehouse.

| Yehu’ Zoe Gatsby, 24, warehouse employee, great guy overall but probably keeps a mysterious secret                                                                  | While he’s not looking for well-hidden spots in the warehouse, he wants to easily find where a product is placed and quickly set the position attribute of a product. He is not used to using mobile devices, so an easy design for the app would be the best.                                  |
| Tito Svenson, 56, warehouse manager, pretends he has seen star wars to relate to his younger colleagues but has actually only read the wiki                         | As the warehouse manager, Mr Svenson is responsible for supervising the availability of items and his employees. He needs (and wants) to communicate often with them and would like an app that lets him update product data on the go, may the force be with him or whatever Darth Vader said. |
| Franca Panella, 41, store clerk, has said “I love you” on different occasions, but never actually meant it. She orders weekly from the warehouse through APP.       | Working as a retailer of the warehouse, Ms Panella concerns about the price, general quality and response time from the warehouse. She always loves the lowest price for the best quality, as she loves everyone (or does she?).                                                                |
| Francesco Virgolini, 52, supplier manager, receives loads of orders from different warehouses, he struggles to ship its orders because of the lack of communication | As supplier manager he wants to keep pretty neat all the orders that come from the warehouses in order to keep track of them and ship them adequately.                                                                                                                                          |
